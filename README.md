Swarm Grid Demand Tool (SGDemTool) is a simulation tool for electricity demand time series in swarm grids based on a set of appliances operated by different households.

The tool simulates the usage of these appliances with a random process based on the input data on usage times and durations from household surveys for different week days and seasons.
